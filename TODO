* Thread locking!

* Line by line editor
* Read only part in FullEditor for viewing commented text

* Better CL matching (arg specifiers, no empty or short matches, show ambiguity)

* Timestamps
* Skip topic
* Skip thread

* Undo read 'unread'

* Auto prompt

* Save/restore readbits

* UP/DOWN history

BUGS

* Scrolling when Y >= HEIGHT causes infinte loop
